        <h1>http://www.nebraska.gov</h1>
        <p>I like how the layout of each page, it’s very clean look and well organized. I’m so impressed with the menu navigation, easy to navigate from each menu. I love the use of Bootstrap for resizing the window. </p>
        <p>I’m not big on the Jumbotron with playing the movie clips, but I like each clip is really saying something about the website, such as Nebraska. I would love to see “other government websites” are using the same color schemes as the main page.</p>
        <p>I think they probably used complementary color scheme. The mood of the colors are matching the purpose of the site because when I think of Nebraska, I think of corn, and farming, they got yellow in it.</p>
        <p> I think the primary users of the site is more for older audience. I think website’s chosen design cater to that user base because clean layout with big and bold fonts.</p>
        <p>The task or goal of the user is find out what they’re looking for when visiting the website. I think this site is accomplished because of easy menu bar navigation allowing them to look in each category.</p>

        <h1>http://www.liedcenter.org</h1>
        <p>I love the consistency throughout the website, each page has same look and color scheme, I like the use of bootstrap for resizing. I like the fonts they used, it looks very clean and easy to navigation.</p>
        <p>I don’t like the creamy color they used because for me it’s kind of boring. I don’t like the Jumbotron, I would love to see the slider to display the images.</p>
        <p>I think they probably used monochromatic color, I personally think the colors they chosen are not matching the purpose of the site because for me the Lied Center for entertainment, I just don’t fun and excitement colors unless they want to go with classic feeling. </p>
        <p>I think they probably used monochromatic color, I personally think the colors they chosen are not matching the purpose of the site because for me the Lied Center for entertainment, I just don’t fun and excitement colors unless they want to go with classic feeling. </p>
        <p>The user would be easily accomplished the task because each menu clearly layout what they need to look at.</p>
        <p>I think the user experience is okay, very basic rollover the menu bar navigation, such as the underline and changed to different color when moving the cursor over.</p>
        <h1>https://lincoln.craigslist.org</h1>
        <p>I like the use of the columns and grids for the structuring of the website. It’s a well-categorized.  I like the colors they chose from the fonts with white background, and it’s very easy to stand out especially with the text links.</p>
        <p>I think this website is too much for scrolling, a lot of information to look at. It looks very busy and it might be hard to find the items.</p>
        <p>I think the primary color for this website probably monochromatic, the blue for texts with white background. I think it’s serving the purpose due to the link keywords so that people can related when the users moving the cursor over the texts. That’s the purpose of this website, enabling to find information.</p>
        <p>I think the primary users are everyone, I think the design cater to that user base but careful and knowing what to look for. You got to know what you are looking at and read the descriptive of item careful before commit to it.</p>
        <p>I think the user can easily accomplished the task just need to know when to find the information. </p>
        <p>I don’t think it’s good UX Design because it’s very basic design for the user experience. It’s very easy to use but it has not interacted element except for the rollover highlighted texts and links.</p>
